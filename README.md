# Project 2: The Impact of AI On the U.S. Labor Force

I developed this story as part of Columbia Journalism School's [Lede Data Journalism Program](https://ledeprogram.com/), Summer 2025.

## Aim of Project

In the first few months of Trump's inaugeration I found myself in Canada, struggling to land my next internship. Was it because Trump's tariffs were decimating our economy, because workplaces across the board were shedding jobs due to AI automation, or some other combination of factors I hadn't yet considered? When I found the following dataset from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, I decided to focus on analyzing the impact of AI: https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm


## Findings

I plotted the biyearly labor growth of about 30 different professions that I believed to be most vulnerble to AI. About one-third of the professions I analyzed showed no meaningful net decline in the last decade. The other two-thirds of jobs I analyzed grew at a rate lower than the 14 percent yearly average--but curiously, those professions in decline have stayed so consistently for the last decade. The only exception is personal financial advisors, whose profession has only declined in the last year or two. It would be useful to talk to a labor expert to better understand these phenomena.  


## Summary of Data Collection Process

It took me a very long time to understand the data set. So much so that I originally started analyzing this data in Pandas, and then after a quick crash-course in Excel from one of the TAs, I realized it was so much easier to parse the data in Excel! So I stayed in Excel!


## Overview of Data Analysis

I initially wanted to create an annuvial diagram--then when I realized that that visualization was ill-suited to the data, I pivoted to a bumpchart. Then when I realized that type of chart was also poorly-suited to my data set, I pivoted again, to a hybrid chart-table I generated in Data Wrapper. My take-away is that data visualization is a self-exploratory process! And it would be naive for me to assume what form my visualization will take on ahead of time. 

## New Skills and Approaches Used

I built my first visualization in Datawrapper and the second in RAWGraphs. In order to make them complement one another graphically, I manipulated their individual components in Illustrator and InDesign.

## Ways of Improvement

I feel like I'm a bit better equipped to eyeball datasets and determine which graphic templates are better or worse suited for visualization. This will certainly save me time over the long run.
